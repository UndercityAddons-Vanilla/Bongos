# Bongos (Vanilla)

Creates customized action bars.

This project became Bongos2, Bongos3 and then Dominos.

## Installation

Although functionally one AddOn, Bongos technically is a collection of three separate AddOns:

To install, copy each of the three directories listed above to your _Interface/AddOns_ folder.
